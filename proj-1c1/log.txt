===========================================
Session 1 – Ground Rules
===========================================

User Prompt:
"For this task, you are not allowed to give me vague summaries. You must be precise and concise. Every answer should be structured in use case format: Preconditions, Main Flow (numbered), Subflows (lettered), Alternative Flows (lettered). No filler text, no reasoning paragraphs. Stop talking nonsense."

ChatGPT Response:
"Understood. I will only return structured use cases in the format requested. Please specify the scope of the use cases to begin with."

===========================================
Session 2 – First Attempt at Narrowing
===========================================

User Prompt:
"In Project 1b1, we built 30 use cases for WolfCafe. For 1b2 we need only 10 for the MVP. Select 15–20 of the strongest candidates for MVP, focusing on core workflows like customer ordering, card payment, preparation, and delivery. Exclude taxation, SNAP/EBT, and heavy admin."

ChatGPT Response:
"Here are 18 candidate MVP use cases:

1. Web Order of Prepared Meal with Card  
2. Mobile Order with Dietary Supplements (Card)  
3. Promotions at Checkout  
4. Modify or Cancel Order Before Preparation  
5. Kitchen Fulfillment Through Delivery Completion  
6. Kiosk Quick Order and Pickup  
7. Customer Schedules Future Delivery  
8. Staff Updates Preparation Time  
9. Customer Provides Delivery Instructions  
10. Tip Add/Adjust After Delivery  
11. Card-Based Refunds  
12. Allergen Incident Handling

15. Split Payment (Card + Cash)  
16. In-Route Delivery Change  
17. Inventory Thresholds  
18. Tax Holiday Exemptions"

User Prompt:
"This is not acceptable. You included refunds, allergens, split payments, and tax holidays, which I told you to exclude. Redo it and be strict this time."

ChatGPT Response:
"Refined list to 15 cases. Excluded refunds, allergens, split payments, and tax holidays. Remaining cases emphasize core flows: order placement, promotions, cancelation, fulfillment, kiosk, scheduling, delay management, delivery instructions, tipping, and customer pickup."

===========================================
Session 3 – Parallel Run with Claude

===========================================
Session 4 – Overlap Analysis
===========================================

User Prompt:
"Compare both lists. Give me only the overlaps between ChatGPT’s 15 and Claude’s 14. That will be our MVP."

ChatGPT Response:
"Both systems consistently highlighted 10 overlapping use cases:

1. Web Order of Prepared Meal with Card  
2. Mobile Order with Dietary Supplements (Card)  
3. Promotions at Checkout  
4. Modify or Cancel Order Before Preparation  
5. Kitchen Fulfillment Through Delivery Completion  
6. Kiosk Quick Order and Pickup  
7. Customer Schedules Future Delivery  
8. Staff Updates Preparation Time (Delay Management)  
9. Customer Provides Delivery Instructions  
10. Tip Add/Adjust After Delivery"

User Prompt:
"Yes, this is the right subset. Stick with these 10 only."

===========================================
Session 5 – Expanding to Full Structure
===========================================

User Prompt:
"Expand the 10 selected MVP use cases into full detail. Number the steps in Main Flow, use letters for Subflows and Alternatives. Keep language short and precise. Don’t explain outside the structure."

ChatGPT Response:
(Example output)

Preconditions: Order is “Accepted,” not yet “In Prep.”  
Main Flow:  
1. Customer opens order.  
2. Customer chooses Modify or Cancel.  
3. If Modify: system recalculates totals and requires reauthorization if needed.  
4. If Cancel: system shows refund summary.

6. System updates order status.  
Subflows:  
a. Reauthorization if total increases.  
b. Refund processing depending on settlement timing.  
Alternative Flows:  
a. Order already in prep → change/cancel blocked.  
b. Past cancellation window → request denied.  

… (continued for all 10 use cases)

User Prompt:
"Some of these are still a little wordy. Simplify sentences. One action per line."

ChatGPT Response:
"Revised text for all 10 use cases. Each step reduced to a single short action. Document length ~5 pages."

===========================================
Session 6 – Formatting for LaTeX
===========================================

User Prompt:
"Reformat the 10 use cases in LaTeX. Use \subsection for each case. Main Flow numbered, Subflows lettered, Alternatives lettered. No extra commentary."
