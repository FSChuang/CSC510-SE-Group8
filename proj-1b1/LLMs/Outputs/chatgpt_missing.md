Issue | Evidence (quote/line from materials) | Impact | Fix (new UC title or change)
--|--|--|--
Missing end-to-end order lifecycle and tracking | "Order lifecycle: placed → accepted → in prep → ready → out for delivery → delivered → refund/return." | Core flow to place/track orders is absent; fails Done Criteria and blocks delivery operations. | New UC: Order Placement and Status Tracking (customer view of statuses, cancellations/edits before prep).
Missing delivery dispatch, location selection, and ETA notifications | "Delivery to campus locations; ETA tracking and notifications." | Users can’t choose delivery locations or receive ETAs/updates; delivery experience incomplete. | New UC: Delivery Dispatch, Campus Location Selection, and ETA Notifications.
Missing staff fulfillment workflow | "Staff: views assigned orders, prepares items, marks ready/out-for-delivery/delivered, reports stock issues." | Staff can’t accept/prepare/advance orders; no operational backbone. | New UC: Staff Fulfillment – Accept, Prepare, Mark Ready/Out-for-Delivery/Delivered.
Pickup-only handoff; missing proof-of-delivery for deliveries | "Staff ... deliver" and "Delivery to campus locations" | No delivery confirmation or fraud prevention for deliveries. | New UC: Delivery Handoff & Proof of Delivery (scan code/photo/GPS confirmation).
Missing inventory decrement and stock-out handling | "Inventory updates on preparation; stock-outs trigger alternatives or delays." | Overselling and poor UX when items run out; no substitution flow. | New UC: Inventory Update & Stock-out Substitutions (suggest alternatives, delays, partial fills).
Missing tax/surcharge calculation and receipt itemization | "Tax calculation per item category and jurisdiction; exemptions (e.g., SNAP/EBT items, tax holidays)." and "Local Surcharges: e.g., city soda tax per ounce; itemized separately from sales tax." and "Itemized receipt with tax breakdown; rule-version recorded." | Compliance/audit risk; totals inaccurate; receipts fail requirements. | New UC: Checkout Tax & Surcharge Calculation with Itemized Receipt (stores applied rule-version).
SNAP/EBT eligibility and handling absent | "SNAP/EBT: eligible grocery items not taxed under EBT; hot/prepared items ineligible." | Can’t correctly accept EBT; legal and UX issues (mixed carts, ineligible items). | New UC: SNAP/EBT Eligibility and Payment Handling (cart partition, eligibility checks, tax treatment).
Admin configuration of menu, prices, and rules missing | "Administrator: manages menu (items, options, prices), tax/health rules, inventory thresholds, staff schedules, reports/audits." | Ops cannot maintain catalog/pricing/rules; blocks day‑to‑day changes. | New UC: Admin – Menu, Pricing, and Tax/Health Rule Management (with versions/audit).
Role-based access control not covered | "Data privacy and access control by role." | Security/compliance risk; staff/admin features exposed or inaccessible. | New UC: Role-Based Access Control and Admin/Staff Authentication.
Refunds/returns flow missing | "Order lifecycle ... → refund/return." and "system supports refunds and audits." | Cannot process refunds/disputes; fails Done Criteria. | New UC: Refunds, Returns, and Dispute Resolution (with audit trail).
Receipts UC lacks required tax breakdown and rule version | "Itemized receipt with tax breakdown; rule-version recorded." | Receipts don’t meet auditability requirements. | Change UC 7 (Digital Receipt Archival): include itemized tax/surcharge breakdown and stored applied rule-version.
User registration not explicit | "Users can register, log in, and place/track orders." | Fails Done Criteria; only multi-device login variant exists. | New UC: User Registration and Account Management (profile, password reset).
Operational reporting and audits absent | "Administrator: ... reports/audits." and "reliability and auditability (receipts, rule versions, overrides)." | No visibility/compliance; can’t trace rule changes/overrides. | New UC: Admin Reporting & Audit Logs (orders, inventory, pricing/tax rule versions, overrides).
Staff scheduling not covered | "Administrator: manages ... staff schedules" | Staffing/throughput issues during peaks; cannot plan operations. | New UC: Admin – Staff Scheduling (shifts, assignments, capacity signals).
Overemphasis on multi-device login vs core auth | "Users can register, log in, and place/track orders." | Effort spent on concurrency before baseline auth/roles ready. | Change UC 1: Retitle to Login & Session Management; make multi-device coexistence an optional subflow.
Order sharing not in scoped materials | Functional Scope lists core commerce/ops; no social sharing | Potential scope creep diluting resources from core flows. | Defer UC 9 (Order Sharing) to a later milestone or justify with explicit objectives.
Carbon footprint report not in scoped materials | Functional Scope and Done Criteria omit sustainability reporting | Adds complexity with no linkage to Done Criteria; risk of delay. | Defer UC 10 (Carbon Footprint Report) until core compliance/ops UCs are complete.
